TypeScript Fullstack
=================

A TypeScript template on the client and serverside.


Your Project
------------

On the front-end,
- edit `src/public-src/client.js`, `src/public/style.css` and `src/views/index.html`
- drag in `assets`, like images or music, to add them to your project

On the back-end,
- your app starts at `src/server.ts`
- add frameworks and packages in `src/package.json`
- safely store app secrets in `.env` (nobody can see this but you and people you invite)
