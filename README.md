TypeScript Fullstack
=================

* Server side code executes from `server/server.ts` - using ts-node.
* Client side code is compiled from `public-src` into a bundle called client.js in `public`


Your Project
------------

On the front-end,
- edit `public/client.js`, `public/style.css` and `views/index.html`
- drag in `assets`, like images or music, to add them to your project

On the back-end,
- your app starts at `server.js`
- add frameworks and packages in `package.json`
- safely store app secrets in `.env` (nobody can see this but you and people you invite)
